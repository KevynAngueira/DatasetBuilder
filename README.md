This is a collection of scripts used to automate and simplify the creation of dataset.

OrganizeMedia:
Define an input directory and metadata templates. Then run the script to assign media files to their correct location in the dataset. The script will automatically populate a directory structure based on defined templates and automatically prompt users to fill out metadata files based on the templates. This script simmultaneously creates private and public (sanitized for private information) versions of the dataset.
